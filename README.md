### **Benefits**
✔ Uses the real Windows Explorer so everything will work as Microsoft intended.<br>
✔ Lightweight: ~2 Mb of space and uses ~60 Mb of RAM (less than the native explorer).<br>
✔ Portable: Run it in a folder of your choice, move it to another… no setup is required.<br>
✔ Reliable: Your workspace is always saved and restored. Forget sudden crashes or reboots!<br>
✔ Up-to-date: The explorer core will be updated automatically along with Windows itself.<br>
✔ Modern: Dark mode, customisable tabs, themes and logos, dual-pane browsing, profiles… and more!<br>
✔ Infinite workflow: Open as many windows as you want, name them, pin them or bring them back later.

### **Your data and you style**
✔ All your settings are stored in a subfolder inside the TabExplorer folder, in convenient text files.<br>
✔ You can switch at any time between per-user settings or shared settings for all Windows accounts.<br>
✔ Adding new languages is a matter of just cloning and editing a simple resource text file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: Please note the native part of the file explorer will always use Windows language.

### **Take control!**
✔ Intercept any new Windows Explorer window and convert them in new tabs without changing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obscure system settings! Enable or disable this feature instantly at any moment with just one click.

### **Express yourself**
✔ Set a background image or place your logo in a corner.<br>
✔ Tint everything or apply effects to the image.<br>
✔ Save your themes and apply them or share them!<br>
✔ Switch from Light to Dark mode at any time.

### **Selection made easy**
✔ Start selecting files using simple wildcards (`?` / `*`).<br>
✔ Add new files to it by simply running a new selection!<br>
✔ Or remove some files from it by running another one.<br>
✔ And finally... copy, move, delete at your will.

### **Credits**
💙 *TabExplorer uses components from the Windows® API Code Pack for Microsoft® .NET Framework,*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*originally published by Microsoft as a managed wrapper around various Windows shell features.*<br>
💙 *This project was inspired by the archived copy of these libraries, kindly preserved by*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*[timdetering](https://github.com/timdetering) at [github.com/timdetering/Microsoft.Windows_API_Code_Pack](https://github.com/timdetering/Microsoft.Windows_API_Code_Pack).*

### **API Code Pack custom changes**
✒ *Several modifications were made to the original two libraries to fix issues when navigating*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to certain special folders available only on Windows 11.*<br>
✒ *Additional methods were added to allow redrawing the embedded file explorer,*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*setting focus, and selecting or unselecting files programmatically.*<br>
✒ *Finally, the libraries were updated and recompiled to target the latest*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*.NET Framework version (4.8.1), replacing the older framework originally used.*
